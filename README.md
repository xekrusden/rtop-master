# rtop

`rtop` is a remote system monitor. It connects over SSH to a remote system
and displays vital system metrics (CPU, disk, memory, network). No special
software is needed on the remote system, other than an SSH server and
working credentials.

Only Linux systems can be monitored, and most modern distros will work.

`rtop` is MIT-licensed and can be used anywhere with attribution.

## build

`rtop` is written in [go](http://golang.org/), and requires Go version 1.2
or higher. 

## contribute

Pull requests welcome. Keep it simple.
